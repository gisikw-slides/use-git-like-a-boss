Move out Subversion; there's a new man in town. Learn how a decentralized version control system can help make your workflow easier, regardless of what language you use. We'll walk through how to manage a project using Git, and use some branching, tagging, recovery, and a host of other features along the way. Come see how easy it is to branch and merge without the usual headaches.
